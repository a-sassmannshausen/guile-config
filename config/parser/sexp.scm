;;;;; The Sexp Parser

;; The following rules apply to this parser:
;; - It writes one configuration file for an entire configuration tree.
;;   + We use a nested association list for writing the file.
;;   + Each subcommand contains its own section in the file.
;;   + Inherited <settings> are repeated in each section that inherits them.
;; - It writes the same configuration file to each directory in the
;;   configuration and its subcommands.
;;   + The writer works best in applications where subcommands simply inherit
;;     the directory from root.
;;   + If you have different configuration directories, you may want to
;;     consider a parser that writes multiple configuration files.
;; - The reader simply reads the specific subcommand of the file.
