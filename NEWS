* Changes in 0.2 (since 0.1.1)

** New syntax for specifying `configurations`

We now use a custom records style taken from Guix for the `configuration`
specification, and for all user-visible record types.

This will break previous uses of the config library.

** Add capacity to parse free or positional arguments to a program

Configurations can now be passed a list of `argument` records (see
documentation), which allows programs to parse not just keywords, but also
positional arguments.

** Add inheritance to configurations

Configurations can now inherit common options from their parents using the
`wanted` field of `configuration` records.

** License change to GPLv3+ from AGPLv3+

** Fix test-runner to actually report error when tests fail

** Change dircategory of manual to 'The Algorithmic Language Scheme'

* 0.1.1 Changes in 0.1.1 (since 0.1)

** Bugfix: Fix manual name, so it can be loaded from Info

* 0.1 Initial release
