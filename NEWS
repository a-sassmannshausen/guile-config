* Changes in 0.3 (since 0.2 [undocumented here])

** Use Guile Hall to manage project infrastructure.
** Settings are now no longer run through handlers.
   It is expected the parser ensures settings from commandlines have the
   correct type.  They are still run against tests.
** Configuration Files are assumed to provide mandatory arguments.
   If they are not provided they will resolve to <empty> when they are first
   accessed.
** Ensure we run handlers over arguments on command-line.
** We support single-configuration files for an entire program space.
** The sexp-parser now provides a single-configuration file variant.
